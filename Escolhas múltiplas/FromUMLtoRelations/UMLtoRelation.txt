Alternatives:
A.
Person(nif(pk), name)
R1(X->Player(pk), Y->Player)
Club(id(pk), address)
R2(clubId->Club(pk), personId->Person, nr(pk))
Player(nif->Person(pk), number)
Team(name(pk))
Season(year(pk))
R3(nif->Player(pk), name->Team(pk), year->Season(pk))

B.
Person(nif(pk), name)
R1(X->Player(pk), Y->Player)
Club(id(pk), address)
R2(clubId->Club(pk), personId->Person(pk), nr)
Player(nif->Person(pk), number)
Team(name(pk))
Season(year(pk))
R3(number->Player(pk), name->Team(pk), year->Season(pk))

C.
Person(nif(pk), name)
R1(X->Player(pk), Y->Player(pk))
Club(id(pk), address)
R2(clubId->Club(pk), personId->Person(pk), nr)
Player(nif->Person(pk), number)
Team(name(pk))
Season(year(pk))
R3(nif->Player(pk), name->Team(pk), year->Season(pk))

D.
Person(nif(pk), name)
R1(x->Player(pk), y->Player)
Club(id(pk), address)
R2(clubId->Club, personId->Person(pk), nr(pk))
Player(nif->Person(pk), number)
Team(name(pk))
Season(year(pk))
R3(nif->Player(pk), name->Team(pk), year->Season(pk))

Explanation:
The option B is wrong because a foreign-key should consist on the attributes that belong to the primary key of the class that we want to referenciate.
The option C is wrong because the primary key for this relation is only X, due to the multiplicity associated to the X side of the relation.
The option D is wrong because the same person could have the same number in different clubs. This option implies that a person has different numbers in different clubs.

Correct: A
