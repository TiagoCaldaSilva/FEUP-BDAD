If you run twice the command .read bdad.sql :

Alternatives:
A. The result is an error because the table Player doesn't have a primary key.
B. Each one of the tables Country and Player will have a single row.
C. The result is an error due to the delete action associated to the foreign key.
D. Each one of the tables Country and Player will have two rows with the same content.
E. The table Country will have a single row and the table Player will have 2 rows with the same content (because it hasn't a predefined primary key).

In that case, this is the result:

Correct: C
