<image>
i. A store is supplied by a supplier per company.
ii. One supplier can be also a client and buy the product that supplies to the store.
iii. A store buys a product by the price of the supplier's company.
iv. In the case that a store needs a product, there is always a supplier that can supply that product.

Alternatives:
A. Only i
B. Only ii and iii
C. Only iii and iv
D. Only i, iii and iv
E. All of them

Explanation:
i. Wrong because a store can be supplied by two or more suppliers from the same company. A store can have one or more suppliers regardless of the company that they represent.
ii. Correct because it is an overlapping generalization. In that case, a client can be either a supplier or a employee, per exemple.
iii. Wrong because the product's price depends on the supplier and not the company of the supplier. Different suppliers of the same company can sell the same products by different prices.
iv. Wrong because it is possible to exist a product that can't be supplied by any supplier.

Correct: D
